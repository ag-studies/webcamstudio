Too many software developers are forgetting that in the end, a regular user will want to use their software.  Even if the command line can be fun and powerful, it is easier to simply point-and-click to execute some tasks.

So with that in mind, a regular user must be able to do this:

  # Download the package
  # Install the package by double-clicking on it
  # Start the application from the menu
  # Use it right away without having to compile anything
