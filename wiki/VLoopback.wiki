#summary VLoopback Description

= Introduction =

A VLoopback device is a virtual device that provides a mean to simulate a video input.


= Details =

When you connect a webcam to a linux computer, a special device is created in the /dev/ folder generally name /dev/video0.  If you have more of those devices, then the names will increase in numbering like /dev/video1, /dev/video2, etc...

A VLoopback device is a module loaded dynamically in the kernel to provide a virtual video input device.  To make it work, this device has to be fed by a video stream of a pre-define format: size, frame rate and color format.

For example:  the original vloopback module from the Motion project, is a V4L device supporting a wide range of sizes and framerate, but only in RGB format.

Another project ported that code to V4L2Loopback to provide compatibility with V4L2 compatible software.  It's a bit more complex, but instead of having 2 virtual device (video1 input, video2 output), it creates only one device that can read and export video stream.

Note:  Since those device are virtual, if your browser is started before WS4GL for example, it is possible that Flash will not recognize those device as video input.  Make sure to start WS4GL first, then your browser (or any other software) so they will be detected properly.
