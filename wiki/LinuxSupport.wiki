= Introduction =
Here are discussed the Linux specifics about !WebcamStudio.

= Details =
  * GStreamer, ffmpeg and libav are available from the package manager of most of the contemporary distributions.  
  * The virtual webcam module is the thing that is a little harder to deploy.
    * !WebcamStudio is using a forked module of [https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback v4l2loopback] (previously vloopback) renamed to webcamstudio.
    * The problem with the recompiling the module for each kernel is fixed for versions 0.60+ on Debian like systems, since it uses [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support DKMS]
  * The original [https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback v4l2loopback] kernel module could be used since versions 0.60+ on Debian like systems
  * On some distributions GStreamer works much better and faster than ffmpeg/libav on the same system (for example this is the case with Gentoo). This should be further investigated.
