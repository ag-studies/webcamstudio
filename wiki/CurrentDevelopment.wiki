This page is for the Developers of WebcamStudio.

Please edit this document as you add here all the tasks/code you are working on, so the others from the WCS Team be aware of what is currently being done in the code of WCS.
When the task is done, just use the strikeout wiki syntax (i.e. surround the task with double tilde ~)

The format of this document should be:

*Task being worked on at the moment* -> *Developer* -> *Approximate time to get the task done*

OR

~~ *Finished task* -> *Developer* -> *Approximate time to get the task done* ~~

 * ~~"Import Studio Channels" and "Import Studio" from a saved studio file to a running studio session. The first add the channels separated from the existing studio channels. In this way if you play the loaded channel, the existing studio streams play status is not affected and viceversa. The second add the loaded studio in the existing one and join the channels. In this way if you play a loaded studio channel, the existing studio streams will stop and viceversa.~~
