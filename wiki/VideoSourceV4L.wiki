#summary Video Source V4L Description

= Introduction =

The video source for V4L device like webcam or tv tuners


= Details =

This source is relying on the gstreamer framework to capture images from a V4L device and output it as a buffered image.

Since gstreamer in used, some special effects from the gstreamer framework can be integrated into the pipeline for more options.  Also, by default, the captured images are resized by default at 320x240 at a rate of 15 frames per seconds.  This is useful as it requires less processing power from the computer.  Often, some HD webcam will generate 1600x1024 images which will make the process heavier in the video mixing.
