= Introduction =

A Video Text source transforms some text content into a buffered image


= Details =

This is a special source that has some specific features.  Mainly, you will find that setText(), getText() are used to update the text content.

The first thing that needs to be done is to define an image size on which we will draw the text content.  This size is not the same as the output size of the source.  So you can create a very large area, put your text, and the output size will be used to resized the whole image to what is needed in the mixer.  Be careful as resizing will sometime render the text unreadable to on virtual output.

The text content is broken in to lines at first.  The, each line length is compare with the width of the area.  If the line is too long, it will be truncated and the other part of the line will be drawn on the next line.  Also, lines are broken by words, and not at each letter/number to avoid having a word being split on two lines.

Once the lines are properly set, the text content of each line is scanned for TAGS to be replaced by the content (Like date and time).  Once everything is done, then all the updated text is drawn.

Added to this, text can be scrolled in a 4 directions.  Some more calculation is done to enable the scrolling effect by lines (Up and down) or by word (Left, Right).  A bit tricky to implement, but it does the job.
