= Introduction =

Here anyone of the developers can add his ideas about the architecture of WebcamStudio, its GUI, plugins etc. and discuss all this in the comments below.


= GUI =
   # When the user needs to add a new source like webcam for example, now clicking the button, adds all sources that can be found under _/dev/video`*`_...
     * A drop-down list to be offered before the user adds any such source is needed
     * We need to have in mind that at this level of sources, often there is a DVB or any other TV card listed under _/dev/video`*`_ i.e. we need to add additional functionality for commanding such devices, so the user can choose a channel from his DVB etc card
   # There should be a check on what the user has as installed applications (between gstreamer/libav and ffmpeg) and depending on the result the user to be able to select the app used for every source or collection...
   # The input method for setting stream attributes is a little bit tricky. We have to find an alternative user friendly input method for things like Width, Height, etc... and a better design for the user interface.
