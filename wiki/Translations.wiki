#summary Translation mechanism

= Introduction =

Here is the translation mechanism used by WS4GL


= Details =

Java has the internal ability to support multi-language applications.  To used that feature, WebcamStudio is using the Languages.properties file as the base for English labels.

The content of the file is quite simple:  TheTagName = The tag descripton

One line for each tag.  The text must be in unicode so it is best to used the Netbeans environment to edit those files especially is the language contains accents like French.

For each specific language, a new file is created in this format Languages_fr.properties, fr being for french.

To add a new language, one must import the base file Languages.properties, and copy it to the desired language (using the 2 letters of the language).  And then, just translated each label as needed.

On the next build, the new file will be integrated and upon loading, Java is looking at the current locale and loads the proper language files.  If no file is found, then it will load the default file being languages.properties (English)
