#summary Controls Description

= Introduction =

A Control, is a panel that will manage some options related to a source


= Details =

Each video source has specific settings that needs to be applied.  Thats where the Controls show-up.

Each source, can provide the required controls to manage it.  These Controls are simply JPanel, with an interface of Controls to be able to access them.

For example, a movie will have controls like Position, Effects, and so on...  But the webcam will have Face Detection and Text will have the Text Format Control.

This way, more controls can be created and only the affected sources needs to be modified to include the required controls.
