= Introduction =

This is the name of the project called WebcamStudio

= Goal =

The main goal of WebcamStudio is to provide a user level application that is easy to use, and behave like a normal desktop application.  Overall, the user wants to get several video sources, mix them together and send that to a virtual webcam.  This virtual webcam will then be used by other software like Adobe Flash, Skype or Empathy to broadcast the mixed videos.

Anything that can provide an image, like a webcam, a jpeg, a movie etc is considered as a source. If it shows up, it can be used! That's the rule.

See the [Philosophy] page for more in-depth of the project's goals.
