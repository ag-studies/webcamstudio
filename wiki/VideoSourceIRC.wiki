#summary Video Source IRC description
= Introduction =

This source will connect to any IRC chat room


= Details =

Using libraries, this source can connect to almost any IRC chat room, and display in a buffered image the text content from the chat room.  Emoticon has been implemented for some smylies but not all of them.

At the base, an IRC server is required, a user name and a chat room name.  Password protected room/login are not supported for now.

Even if it is possible to interact with the chat room thru that source, I have removed any mean of doing so as they're better IRC client out there and WS4GL is not meant to be an IRC client.

The source is listening for incoming text, look for the sender and then create a text of line that will be displayed in the buffered image.  In the process, any smilies will be replaced by the according graphics from the icon list in the resources.

The source will login when starting it and disconnect when stopping it.
