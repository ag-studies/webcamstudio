WebcamStudio 0.73
*****************

Hello and welcome to the new WebcamStudio.  This release is a buggy and unstable one, so be gentle.

There is still missing features compared to WS0.57, but they will come.

What you need:
- Java >= 1.7
- AVCONV - FFMPEG - Windows users should download the proper ffmpeg static binary and put it in their PATH.
  The URL is: http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds
- Some patience ;)


How to use:
-----------

- Drag'n drop your sources (movies, images, music) into the "Sources" panel (the middle one)
- Webcams are auto-detected on startup.
- Audio Preview is not activated by default, click the "Mixer" tab, and click the little speaker to activate it.
  Carefull with audio feedback!
- Each source has a layer to use. Only one source can be on a layer. If more than one have the same layer,
  only one of them will be displayed.
- "Record" button will record audio and video into a selected file. AVI, FLV, OGG are well supported.
  MPG cannot be used at the moment. WebM needs some tweaks.
- To broadcast to Justin.tv or Bambuser, download your FME configuration file (XML), and drag'n drop the file in the "Output" panel.
- You may need to tweak the FME file if the broadcasting bitrate is too high for your internet access.
- To remove a "broadcast button", drag it to the right, it will be removed.
- VLOOPBACK (v4l2loopback, webcamstudio) are auto detected in the "Output" panel.  They are not activated by default.
- You can save your setup in a Studio file in this version.
- For high res mixing (640x480), you should use a compiled version of FFMPEG/AVCONV on your computer.  This really helps the encoding part!
- Start with a small setup first (320x240@15fps) before doing the hardcore stuff.
- This version is mostly stable under linux.  Windows and OSX need more testing.
- You can create your own source, by creating a file "Something.wss".  See the "CustomSource.wss" example in the archive's "docs" folder
- Have fun!


Some testing to do:
-------------------

- Start a webcam, check if audio/video are lagging after a while.
- Start a Desktop source. There is no audio with desktop.  See if computer is dying.
- Record a mix of audio/video into an AVI file. Check if the file is readable and have audio/video in sync.
- Use the vloopback output.  Check if video is stuttering (No audio in this mode).
- Add an FME file to broadcast to Justin.tv, Bambuser, Ustream or VaughnTv (IceCast and Red5 are also supported)
